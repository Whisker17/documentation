title: Using the Faucet
---

Zeitgeist's test network [Battery Station](./battery-station) uses the ZBS
token, instead of the ZTG. ZBS is provided to users through a frictioned faucet
on Discord in order to allow for testing and experimentation.

To gain access to the faucet, a NFT from one of three different collections is
required. Keep an eye on the announcements to not miss the opportunity to obtain
limited access to the faucet and consequently the beta.

## Getting ZBS

### Using the !drip command

The normal way to get ZBS from the faucet is to use the !drip command.

- First create a new Zeitgeist account (standard Substrate account) using the
  Polkadot-JS Extension that is available
  [here](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/).
- Follow the instructions
  [here](./how-to-participate-in-derby#create-a-zeitgeist-account) for creating
  an account.
- Go to Zeitgeist's Discord server and enter into the #faucet channel.
- Copy your address from the extension, ensure that it's in Substrate generic or
  Battery Station format (begins with either a "5" or "d").
- Type in `!drip <address>` to the faucet channel.
- The faucet should respond that it sent you some ZBS.
- After completing this you will have a 24 hour cooldown until you can get more
  ZBS.
