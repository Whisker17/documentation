:::important Zeitgeist Battery Park is still in an alpha "unreleased" phase. You
can follow this guide to connect to it but some things might not work yet. If
you would like to report a bug please open an issue on our GitHub repository.
Also note that the chain is liable to be reset **at any time without warning.**
:::

Battery Park is the name of the Zeitgeist testnet. It is named after
[The Battery](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battery_(Manhattan)>), a
luscious park on the southern tip of Manhattan island with a view of the Statue
of Liberty.

If you want to support and strengthen Battery Park by running your own network
node, head over to the section [Get Connected](battery-park#get-connected). If
you want to interact with Battery Park, head over to the section
[Accessing the User Interface](battery-park#accessing-the-user-interface)

## Get connected

This section will guide you through setting up your own node. Under the current
average system load, the node can be run on a Raspberry PI 4B (built from
source):

- CPU: Broadcom BCM2711, Quad core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz
- RAM: 4 GB
- Hard drive: SSD recommended, but also works on MicroSD for low loads

The minimum system requirements under continuous full system load are:

- CPU: Ryzen 5 3600
- RAM: 32 GB (less should be sufficient, but was not tested)
- Hard drive: SSD

There are two ways that you can run a node and connect to the Battery Park
testnet. One way is to
[build the code from source](battery-park#building-from-source). On recent
hardware this should take about 5-10 minutes.
[The other way](battery-park#using-docker) is to use
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) which doesn't need to build and can get you
started right away.

### Building from source

_Note for Windows users: Although it should be possible to build this project_
_on Windows, it is not well supported. Instead it is recommended to build this_
_project inside WSL in Windows. If you want to build this on Windows anyways,_
_you can follow
[this tutorial](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/windows-users)_
_to setup your build environment and continue with this tutorial afterwards._
_We have not tested building on Windows and cannot guarantee that it will work._

The source code is hosted in the
[zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist](https://github.com/zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist) repository on
the Zeitgeist GitHub.

To be able to compile the project, Rust must be installed on your system. We
recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/#) to manage your rust build
environments. This instructions will assume that you have rustup installed.

You will need to clone the code locally, and make sure that you have the
[dependencies](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/#1-build-dependencies)
installed. Execute the following commands to fetch the project:

```sh
# clone the code locally
git clone https://github.com/zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist.git
# change directory
cd zeitgeist
```

Next configure rustup, on Unix you can execute the following script:

```sh
# use the initializer script
./scripts/init.sh
```

Otherwise configure rustup manually:

```sh
rustup update nightly-2021-03-10
rustup update stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly-2021-03-10
```

After initializing you can then start building by using the cargo command:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Once the build has finished you will have the _zeitgeist_ binary available in
the _target/release_ folder. You can start a node for Battery Park from the root
of the directory like so:

```sh
./target/release/zeitgeist --chain battery_park
```

You should see your node begin to sync blocks.

The previous command will store the chain data in
_$HOME/.local/share/zeitgeist/chains/battery_park_. You can choose a different
location, for example _/services/zeitgeist_ by using the `-d` parameter:

```sh
./target/release/zeitgeist -d /services/zeitgeist --chain battery_park
```

Ensure that you have write permissions for the path. In case you want to use the
_/services/zeitgeist_ folder at the root of the file system, you will have to
change the ownership to the user who runs the Zeitgeist node (called _user_
here):

```sh
chown -R user:user /services/zeitgeist
```

If you want to receive rewards through the
[Zeitgeist collator program](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc857iTOfp_3CHCdh7qeZwkD_vQfxFeARbMsjhrCF12YBGsuQ/viewform)
for running a node, you have to ensure that your node id is permanent and your
node has an high up-time. Your node id is derived from a secret, that is stored
within _/services/zeitgeist/chains/battery_park/network/secret_ed25519_. First
ensure that the file is read-only:

```
chmod 400 /services/zeitgeist/chains/battery_park/network/secret_ed25519
```

Then backup your secret file to a safe place, such that you can continue to earn
rewards for that node id after a loss of data.

Your node id is printed by the node shortly after it has been started. It looks
like this:

> Local node identity is: 12D3KooWKzzeu1thnWQv8CCWaugFfpeCXnq7jmp6GENSdXqG5xX9

In addition, you should ensure that your node has a maximum up-time, because
your rewards will depend on it. To do this, you could use a systemd service,
that automatically starts your Zeitgeist chain and restarts it in case of an
error. To do so, you can follow the guide at
[Automatically running the Zeitgeist chain as a systemd service (Linux)](battery-park#automatically-running-the-zeitgeist-chain-as-a-systemd-service-linux).

Feel free to play around with the other available options, which you can inspect
by executing:

```sh
./target/release/zeitgeist --help
```

#### Automatically running the Zeitgeist chain as a systemd service (Linux)

To automatically start and restart the zeitgeist chain, you can use a systemd
service. It is not recommended to do this with a docker image, but for a
zeitgeist binary that was built from source it is perfectly adequate.

We will create a non-privileged user to execute the Zeitgeist node, setup the
folder structure, create a systemd service file, launch the service and inspect
the output.

Create a new user (without a home folder) and disable login for that user
(ensure to copy&paste both commands sequentially to ensure they're executed):

```sh
sudo useradd -M zeitgeist
```

```sh
sudo usermod zeitgeist -s /sbin/nologin
```

Create a folder that will contain the Zeitgeist data and the previously compiled
binary file (see [Building from source](battery-park#building-from-source)).
Note down were your _zeitgeist_ binary lies (it is within the source folder at
_target/release_) and replace the path after the `cp` command that is shown
below. In this example we will use _/services/zeitgeist_ as the base folder for
our service, _/service/zeitgeist/bin_ will contain the _zeitgeist_ binary and
the whole _/services/zeitgeist_ folder structure will be owned by the
non-privileged zeitgeist user we created during the previous step:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /services/zeitgeist/bin
sudo cp /path/to/your/target/release/zeitgeist /services/zeitgeist/bin
sudo chown -R zeitgeist:zeitgeist /services/zeitgeist
```

Create a systemd service file. You can use your favorite editor, in this example
we will use `nano` though, because it is well supported.

```sh
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/zeitgeist-node.service
```

You can just use the following template or adjust it to your needs:

```sh
[Unit]
Description=Zeitgeist chain node
After=network.target
Requires=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=zeitgeist
Group=zeitgeist
RestartSec=5
Restart=always
Nice=0
ExecStart=/services/zeitgeist/bin/zeitgeist \
			-d /services/zeitgeist \
			--chain battery_park


[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

You can adjust the _Nice_ value to configure the priority of the process the
service spawns. 20 is the lowest, -20 the highest priority.

_Note: If you want to participate in the
[Zeitgeist collator program](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc857iTOfp_3CHCdh7qeZwkD_vQfxFeARbMsjhrCF12YBGsuQ/viewform),_
_you should also add a `--name your_node_name` parameter at the end of the_
_ExecStart argument of the service file._

Paste your copy buffer into nano by pressing `CTRL+SHIFT+V` and save the changes
by pressing `CTRL+X`, `y` and `ENTER`

Enable the service and start it:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable zeitgeist-node
sudo systemctl start zeitgeist-node
```

Check if it is up and running and syncing with the rest of the network:

```sh
systemctl status zeitgeist-node
```

If it shows _Active: active (running)_, your service works as expected. Use the
following command to retrieve your node id:

```sh
journalctl -u zeitgeist-node.service | grep "node id"
```

Otherwise enter the following command and inspect what went wrong:

```
journalctl -u zeitgeist-node
```

If you are stuck with an error you can ask for assistance in our
[node-operators Discord channel](https://discord.gg/WD3VkGt9eY).

### Using Docker

We publish the latest version to the
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist-node) that can be
pulled and ran locally to connect to the network. In order to do this first make
sure that you have Docker installed locally.

#### Downloading the docker image

```sh
docker pull zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist-node:latest
```

#### Running the docker image

You can run the docker image using the following command, but the node id and
the chain data are lost after you shut down the docker container:

```sh
docker run zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist-node:latest --chain battery_park
```

To keep the chain data, you will have to select a folder on your system that
docker will use to store its files in. Ensure that the folder does exist.
Assuming the path you want to use locally is _/services/zeitgeist_, the command
would be:

```sh
docker run -v /services/zeitgeist:/zeitgeist zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist-node:latest -d /zeitgeist --chain battery_park
```

Ensure that you have write permissions for the path. In case you want to use the
_/services/zeitgeist_ folder at the root of the file system, you will have to
change the ownership to the user who runs the Zeitgeist node (called _user_
here). On Unix systems, you can change the ownership by using the following
command:

```sh
chown -R user:user /services/zeitgeist
```

If you want to receive rewards through the
[Zeitgeist collator program](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc857iTOfp_3CHCdh7qeZwkD_vQfxFeARbMsjhrCF12YBGsuQ/viewform)
for running a node, you have to ensure that your node id is permanent and your
node has an high up-time. Your node id is derived from a secret, that is stored
within _/services/zeitgeist/chains/battery_park/network/secret_ed25519_. First
ensure that the file is read-only. On Unix:

```
chmod 400 /services/zeitgeist/chains/battery_park/network/secret_ed25519
```

On Windows (assuming you have chosen the path _C:\services\zeitgeist_):

```sh
attrib +r "C:\services\zeitgeist\chains\battery_park\network\secret_ed25519"
```

Then backup your secret file to a safe place, such that you can continue to earn
rewards for that node id after a loss of data.

Your node id is printed by the node shortly after the `docker run` command was
executed. The message looks like this:

> Local node identity is: 12D3KooWKzzeu1thnWQv8CCWaugFfpeCXnq7jmp6GENSdXqG5xX9

That's it, your node should be running and syncing with other nodes, while using
a persistent chain storage and node id. If you want to participate in the
collators program, you should ensure that your node has a maximum up-time,
because your rewards will depend on it. It is suggested to automatically start
and restart the docker container that runs the node, which is explained in
[Automatically running the Zeitgeist chain as a docker service](battery-park#automatically-running-the-zeitgeist-chain-as-a-docker-service).

#### Automatically running the Zeitgeist chain as a docker service

To automatically start a docker container every time (including after reboots
and errors), except when it was explicitly stopped by a docker command, append
the `-d` and `--restart` flag to the `docker run` command from above:

```sh
docker run --restart unless-stopped -d -v /services/zeitgeist:/zeitgeist zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist-node:latest -d /zeitgeist --chain battery_park
```

_Note: If you want to participate in the
[Zeitgeist collator program](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc857iTOfp_3CHCdh7qeZwkD_vQfxFeARbMsjhrCF12YBGsuQ/viewform),_
_you should also add a `--name your_node_name` parameter at the end of_ _the
supplied command._

After the command was executed, one line is printed in the terminal that
represents the container id. It looks like this:

> 1e501c25e43be3f2cecc3bade11b22f60f17839d41b37cdac9139cb8ebc8700b

To retrieve your node id, execute the following command (replace _container_id_
with the container id that was printed to your terminal):

```sh
docker logs container_id
```

The previous command shows the outputs of the node. It should include one line
containing your node id, that looks like:

> Local node identity is: 12D3KooWKzzeu1thnWQv8CCWaugFfpeCXnq7jmp6GENSdXqG5xX9

You can also retrieve the container id by using the following command (you might
have to replace _latest_ with the docker image version you use):

```sh
docker ps --filter ancestor=zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist-node:latest
```

### Ensuring that you can restore your node's id

For anybody who has entered a node id in any of our forms, it is essential that
you backup the corresponding node secret after you have set up the node to
ensure, that you always can restore the node id that you have entered and
consequently are always able to continue gathering rewards based on that node
id.

Your node's id is derived from a secret seed. If you lose access to the data of
your node, it is impossible to restore your node id, unless you have created a
backup as long as you had access to the data.

#### Backing up the node secret file from a docker service

The following sections will explain how to retrieve the path to the node secret
on Unix and Windows based systems. After retrieving the path, copy the file
located at the path to a safe location that is not on the same machine where you
copied the file from.

##### On Unix

```sh
echo "$(CONTAINER_ROW=`docker ps | grep zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist-node` && docker inspect --format '{{range .Mounts}}{{println .Destination}}{{end}}' ${CONTAINER_ROW%% *} | sed -n '2p')/chains/battery_park/network/secret_ed25519"
```

##### On Windows

First get the container id:

```sh
docker ps | findstr "zeitgeist"
```

The container ID is the leftmost number in the row. Then get the volume it's
mounted to (replace _container_id_ with the id you extracted during the previous
step):

```sh
docker inspect --format '{{range .Mounts}}{{println .Destination}}{{end}}' container_id
```

Last, append the following string to the last path in the output:
_\chains\battery_park\network\secret_ed25519_ The resulting string is the
location of the secret file.

#### Backing up the node secret file from a systemd service

The following command will print the location of your node's secret file (you
might have to replace _zeitgeist-node_ with the name of your Zeitgeist node
service):

```sh
SECRET_LOCATION=`journalctl -u zeitgeist-node | grep "Database: RocksDb at"` && echo ${SECRET_LOCATION##* RocksDb at } | sed 's/\/db/\/network\/secret_ed25519/'
```

Copy the file to a safe location that is not on the same machine you copied the
file from.

#### Restoring the node id

Before the node is started, the node secret file backup has to be put in the
data folder of the Zeitgeist node. The steps to restore the node id differ a bit
between docker and systemd and are described in the following sections.

##### Restoring the node id within a docker service

First copy the node secret backup file _secret_ed25519_ into the docker folder
that was mounted using the _-v_ command. For example, if the docker command you
use to run the node is

```sh
docker run --restart unless-stopped -d -v /services/zeitgeist:/zeitgeist zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist-node:latest -d /zeitgeist --chain battery_park
```

then you have to place the backed up node secret file into
_/services/zeitgeist_. If that folder does not exist yet, create it and ensure
docker has the permissions to read from and write into it.

After that, append the following option to the `docker run` command:

```sh
--node-key-file /services/zeitgeist/secret_ed25519
```

Don't forget to replace _/services/zeitgeist/_ with the directory you copied the
backup into. In case the backup is located at _/services/zeitgeist_, the
complete command to run your Zeitgeist node with the restored node id as a
docker service would look like this:

```sh
docker run --restart unless-stopped -d -v /services/zeitgeist:/zeitgeist zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist-node:latest -d /zeitgeist --chain battery_park --node-key-file /services/zeitgeist/secret_ed25519
```

The previous command will print the container id. Use it to verify, that the
Zeitgeist node does indeed use your old node's id (replace _container_id_):

```sh
docker logs container_id
```

##### Restoring the node id within systemd

First copy the node secret backup file _secret_ed25519_ into the data folder of
your Zeitgeist node. You can use the following command to retrieve the data
folder (replace _zeitgeist-node.service_ with the name of your Zeitgeist systemd
file):

```sh
cat /etc/systemd/system/zeitgeist-node.service | grep -- "-d "
```

After copying the node secret file backup to this location, append the following
line to the line starting with _ExecStart_ within your Zeitgeist systemd file
(replace _/services/zeitgeist_ with the data folder, in which you placed your
backup): `--node-key-file /services/zeitgeist/secret_ed25519`

Stop any running node, update the daemon and start the node again (replace
_zeitgeist-node_):

```sh
sudo systemctl stop zeitgeist-node; sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl start zeitgeist-node
```

Finally, verify that the Zeitgeist node does indeed use your old node's id
(replace _zeitgeist-node_):

```sh
journalctl -u zeitgeist-node.service | grep "node id"
```

### Connecting to Telemetry

By default, your node will connect to Parity's telemetry endpoint that is
accessible at [https://telemetry.polkadot.io](https://telemetry.polkadot.io).
You can ensure your node is up and running by visiting this page, selecting the
"Zeitgeist Battery Park" network and searching for your node's name (search can
be started by simply typing while on the telemetry page).

#### Alternative Telemetry

Since we've recently hit the limit of 500 active nodes on Parity's telemetry
server, we've also set up our own Telemetry server. You can now also see if your
node is connected by visiting our page at
[https://telemetry.zeitgeist.pm](https://telemetry.zeitgeist.pm).

## Accessing the user interface

You can access the campaign we put together to celebrate the Kusama parachain
auctions and help incentivize our testnet at:
[https://proto.zeitgeist.pm/kusama-derby](https://proto.zeitgeist.pm/kusama-derby)

You can follow our [kusama-derby tutorial](how-to-participate-in-derby) to learn
how to interact with it. This is not the full Zeitgeist application, it is only
one special use case. The full Zeitgeist application will be released in the
future.

You can also access the Apps based (advanced) UI at:
[https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://bp-rpc.zeitgeist.pm](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://bp-rpc.zeitgeist.pm)

## Faucet

We operate a [faucet](using-the-faucet), that can be used to receive the native
Zeitgeist currency for the Battery Park testnet, ZBP (Zeitgeist Battery Park),
which is required for numerous interactions with Battery Park. You will need an
account to retrieve ZBP.

There are numerous ways to generate an account, we suggest to use
[Polkadot{.js} extension](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension) though,
because it is simple and straightforward to use. You can get it at:

- [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd)
- [Firefox add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension/)
