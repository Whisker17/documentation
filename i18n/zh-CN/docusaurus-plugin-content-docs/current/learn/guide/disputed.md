# Dispute

When a market ends the Reported stage, there will be a 24h dispute period. At this stage, if you disagree with the results reported by Oracle, you can dispute it through `Dispute Outcome`.

You can choose the result you think is correct in the upper right corner, and dispute a certain amount of ZBS by deposit. If the dispute is successful, Oracle will be slashed.
