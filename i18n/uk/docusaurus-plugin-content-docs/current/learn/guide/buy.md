- The red box in the upper right corner indicates the current price of the result token
- The red box on the left indicates the number of tokens you currently own for the result
- The lower right corner represents the current transaction fee

It should be noted that if your balance is not enough to pay for the result token you need to buy, the transaction fee will still be deducted, but the result token will not be credited.
