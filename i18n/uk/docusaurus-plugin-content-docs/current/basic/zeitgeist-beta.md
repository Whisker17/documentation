The beta application takes a snapshot every couple of minutes. If you've just
bought the NFT, you may have to wait until the next snapshot is taken until you
can gain access.

## Getting ZBS

Battery Station uses the ZBS token, instead of ZTG. ZBS is provided to users through a frictioned faucet on Discord in order to allow for testing and experimentation. To gain access to the faucet, an NFT from one of the collections above is required.

### Using the !drip command

The normal way to get ZBS from the faucet is to use the !drip command.

- First create a new Zeitgeist account (standard Substrate account) using the Polkadot-JS Extension that is available [here](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/).
- Follow the instructions from [Account Generation](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-account-generation) for creating a new account. Once you have created an account, select either "Use on any chain" or "Zeitgeist Battery Station" in the side menu of the new account.
- Go to Zeitgeist's Discord server and enter into the #faucet channel.
- Copy your address from the extension, ensure that it's in Substrate generic or Battery Station format (begins with either a "5" or "d").
- Type in `!drip <address>` to the faucet channel.
- The faucet should respond that it sent you some ZBS.
- After completing this you will have a 24 hour cooldown until you can get more ZBS.
